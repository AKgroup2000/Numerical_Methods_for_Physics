[Here is the whitepaper for the theory.](http://astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/reviews/num_hw1.pdf)\r\n\r\n* Ordinary Differential Equations: Eulder and Euler-Cromer methods, Verlet method. [Here is the whitepaper for the theory.](http://astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/reviews/num_hw2.pdf)\r\n\r\n* Linear Algebra and FFTs: time series for the damped driven pendulum, matrix inverse,  conditional number.
